# STAT-3355-Project

The clean_data(2) is the version with all the officer positions. 

NOTE: when I was researching how to do this I realized there are a lot of overlapping titles for officers. The methodology behind how I did everything was to just use the titles of the highest position they held so we wouldn't have like 200 different labels to deal with.
- For example there are Detective Lieutenants, but the Lieutenant portion of their position is higher than just Detective so Detective   Lieutenants have their position labeled as Lieutenant. 
- Likewise for Chief Detectives they are labelled as just detectives for the reason stated above
